    """
        Class converting a card into an integer for fast poker evaluation, inspired by Will Drevo
        Card objects are transformed into native Python 32-bit integers.
        Most of the bits are used, and have a specific meaning. See below:
        .. table:: Card
            :align: center
            :widths: auto
            ========  ========  ========  ========

            ========  ========  ========  ========
        - p = prime number of rank (in binary) (deuce=2, trey=3, four=5, ..., ace=41), on 6 bits [0-63]
        - r = rank of card (in binary) (deuce=0, trey=1, four=2, five=3, ..., ace=12), on 4 bits [0-15]
        - cdhs = suit of card (bit turned on based on suit of card)
        - b = bit turned on depending on rank of card (deuce=1st bit, trey=2nd bit, ...)
        - x = unused

         This representation allows for minimal memory overhead along with fast applications
        necessary for poker:
            - Make a unique prime product for each hand (by multiplying the prime bits)
            - Detect flushes (bitwise && for the suits)
            - Detect straights (shift and bitwise &&)
